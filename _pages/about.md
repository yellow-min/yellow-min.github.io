I earned my Ph.D. from KAIST @ <a href="http://cholab.or.kr/">**Systems & Synthetic Biology Laboratory**</a>.

My research interest includes:
-	**Systems Biology**: Leveraging multi-omics data from high-throughput screening and next-generation sequencing, combined with computational analyses, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of gene regulatory networks and microbiome interactions.
-	**Synthetic Biology**: Applying design principles from systems biology to construct microbial strains and biological systems through genome and metabolic engineering, and to develop module-based genetic circuits. Additionally, conducting validation experiments to ensure and optimize the functionality of engineered strains.
- **Applications**: Developing and optimizing microbial strains to create therapeutic microbes for healthcare applications, establish mRNA vaccine and therapeutic cell platforms, and produce industrially valuable compounds.

## Skills
- **Omics studies**
  - Multi-omics data integration and analysis: genomics (whole-genome sequencing), transcriptomics (RNA-seq), functional genomics (CRISPRi screening), microbiomics (16S rRNA metagenomics)

- **Experimental skills** 
    - High-throughput screening, sequencing library construction, next generation sequencing
    - Molecular techniques: genetic manipulation (model and non-model organisms), HPLC, mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE, western blotting, qRT-PCR, protein purification and isolation, kinetic assay, 3D spheroid assay
    - Culture and optimization: adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), culture setting and media optimization

- **Strains**: Expertise with model (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) and non-model (<i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>) organisms in aerobic and anaerobic systems 

- **Cell lines**: mammalian cell culture for HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma cells), MDA-MB-231 and HS578T (human breast cancer cell line)

- **Computational skills**: In-house Python and R pipelines for bioinformatics and data visualization
    -	Website: github.com/yellow-min
